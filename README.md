# DeckToExcel

This program is a start to a larger program that will allow me to track my collection of MtG cards/decks better.
This program uses re to pattern match in txt files garnered from deck sites such as `tappedout.net`.
Additionally, prettytable is used to format the information into a table format for viewing in terminal as well easily converting in and out of a csv format.
A basic class structure is used for the larger scheme of ideas, but will make accessing and modeling out the major components simpler.
